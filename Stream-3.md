# Goals for stream

- [x] add support for unnamed tests
- [x] add support for negative numbers
- [x] add support for action names with spaces

Parser tests are pretty positive for this moment. A lot of duplication is present in code and parsers. 
However, we are moving closer to the end of file. 

In next episodes we will look at 

- action with types (`action Increment by value: Int`)
- scoped reducer
